This project was able to pull tweet information from an instance of [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter). It was intended for use on a labor economics project I was working on at Chapman University.

Unfortunately, the bad guys at twitter found out about Nitter and shut everything down, so these files are null and void now.

The extract_link file still works, though. Simple NLP that detects common characters in URLs and saves entities with those characters to a csv file.
